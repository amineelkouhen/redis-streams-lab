# Exercise 7 - real-time data in action in a complete app: RedisBank

## Running the code

## Tasks

## Next steps

Congrats! You made it to the end of our workshop.

By now you should have a solid overview of Redis data types, ways to interact (CLI, GUI, Java and client options). 

On top of that we also explored some use cases ranging from Redis as a cache to a modern real-time database.
