# Exercise 4 - Streams Consumer Groups

In the previous exercise, we saw that streams can be consumed by a single process using XREAD. For scalability reasons and to avoid bottlenecks, you can be pushed to consume Streams using Consumer groups. In this exercise, we'll dive into this way of Streams consumption and see how to deal with the challenges that come with.


## Next steps

Are you bored of walkthroughs in the CLI/GUI yet? In the next exercise, we're going to move to some actual code. 

So take a short break, get some coffee, and prepare for some coding in [exercise5](exercise-5-start.md).
