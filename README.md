## Redis Streams - Technical Lab
In this hands-on lab you will learn how to create and manipulate Redis Streams. You will learn how easy it is to build extremely fast applications using only a minimum of code. The entire hands-on lab is self-service and is made up of several exercises.

## Prerequisites

* A laptop/desktop equipped with a modern browser
* A working internet connection (use corporate proxies or bad WiFi at your own peril)
* [Pyhton 3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/) is required, along with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and an IDE, e.g. [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [idea](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), [eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/eclipseide/) or [netbeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/)

## Required knowledge

We expect you to be somewhat familiar with Python but if you're not: don't worry, working source code is provided in this hands-on lab.

## Exercises

* Exercise 1 - Streams Simple Add and Reads: [start](exercises/exercise-1-start.md)
* Exercise 2 - GUI: meet RedisInsight: [start](exercises/exercise-2-start.md)
* Exercise 3 - Managing Stream Length: [start](exercises/exercise-3-start.md)
* Exercise 4 - Streams Consumer Groups: [start](exercises/exercise-4-start.md)
* Exercise 5 - Coding: From a RabbitMQ queue to Redis Streams: [start](exercises/exercise-5-start.md)
* Exercise 6 - Coding: Persist Redis Streams to AWS S3: [start](exercises/exercise-6-start.md)

## Troubleshooting

### Redis

Make sure Redis is running when running the exercises. During building this is not required as the integration tests support [Testcontainers](https://www.testcontainers.org/).
